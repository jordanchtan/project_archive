Hi!

1. A lot of the coding was done in Colab, hence the Python Notebooks.

2. Some stuff is in other repos, and are therefore linked.

3. A lot of the code is not cleaned up, and there is some unused code.

4. Some data is stored in my personal Google Drive account (for example pre-trained models amongst other things).

Do contact me if anything is unclear or you want more access (e.g. the S3 bucket I used for the WebApp, stuff in my Google Drive). Sorry if it's a bit messy!

Thanks,
Jordan
