# project_archive

Hi!

1. A lot of the coding was done in Colab, hence the Python Notebooks. Some stuff is in other repos, and are therefore linked.

2. A lot of the code is not cleaned up.

3. Some data is stored in my personal Google Drive account (for example pre-trained models amongst other things). 
   
Do contact me if anything is unclear or not up to scratch. Sorry if it's a bit messy!

Thanks,
Jordan
